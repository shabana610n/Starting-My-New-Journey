Reason of why not using of search method for checking that input value contains numbers or not:

The problem lies in the condition val.search(/[0-9]/). The search method returns the index of the first match if found, otherwise -1. In JavaScript, -1 is considered a truthy value, so your condition val === "" || val.search(/[0-9]/) will always evaluate to true unless val is an empty string. As a result, the alert inside the else block will always execute.

Async/Await:
The async keyword is used before the callback function to indicate that it is an asynchronous function.
await is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by fetch resolves, allowing the code to wait for the response from the API before proceeding.
